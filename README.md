1.) Goals:

---> Develop a CPU scheduling algorithm that minimizes energy consumption while maintaining or improving system performance.

---> Ensure the algorithm is suitable for mobile and embedded systems, where power efficiency is critical.

---> Optimize the algorithm to balance energy savings and computational efficiency.

2.) Expected Outcomes:

---> A functional CPU scheduling algorithm that reduces energy consumption.

---> A simulation or prototype demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in a controlled environment.

---> Documentation and analysis of the algorithm's performance and energy savings.

3.) Scope:

---> The project will focus on designing and implementing the algorithm, testing it in a simulated environment, and analyzing its performance.

---> The algorithm will be tested on a variety of workloads typical of mobile and embedded systems.

---> The project will not involve hardware-level modifications but will focus on software-based scheduling techniques.
